# DATA-PRE-PROCESSING

## Project Description
*This project focuses on data preprocessing using Power BI. 
*Data preprocessing is a critical step in data analysis and modeling, ensuring that the data is clean, organized, and ready for further analysis.
*This project provides a collection of Power BI data preprocessing workflows and techniques to help streamline this essential process.

### Prerequisites
